 * A page is a column-oriented data abstraction that allows data to be passed
 * between {@link Operator}s in terms of small batches of data. Pages are immutable
 * and can be passed between threads.
 *
 * A page has a fixed number of positions (or rows), exposed via {@link #getPositionCount()}.
 * It is further composed of a number of {@link Block}s, which represent the columnar data.
 * The number of blocks can be retrieved via {@link #getBlockCount()}, and the respective
 * blocks can be retrieved via their index {@link #getBlock(int)}. The index of these
 * blocks in the page are referred to as channels.
 *
 * More details on how this integrates with other components can be found in the package documentation of
