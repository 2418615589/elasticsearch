=== Faster indexing and searches on indexed `dense_vector` fields

We've done several optimizations for indexing and searches on high-dimensional
vectors (e.g. making HNSW graph hierarchical, speeding up graph merges,
reusing data structures, better encoding of doc Ids). Lucene-level benchmarks
reported up to 30% improvement in index throughput and 10% faster nearest
neighbor searches on these fields. {es} indices that use indexed `dense_vector`
fields should see these improvements.

===  Up to 20% faster range queries and aggregations
Lucene optimizations brought up speedups in range queries. We have observed 
up to 20% speedups in our nightly benchmarks. Elasticsearch users should notice 
these speedups in range queries as well as aggregations that execute as range 
queries under the hood such as some range or date_histogram aggregations.

=== Integrate filtering support for approximate nearest neighbor search
The {ref}/knn-search-api.html[_knn_search endpoint] now has a "filter" option that allows to return only the nearest documents that satisfy the provided filter
