ifeval::["{release-state}"!="released"]
NOTE: This documentation is for {es} version {version}, which is not yet
released. The above compatibility table applies if both clusters are running a
released version of {es}, or if one of the clusters is running a released
version and the other is running a pre-release build with a later build date. A
cluster running a pre-release build of {es} can also communicate with remote
clusters running the same pre-release build. Running a mix of pre-release
builds is unsupported and typically will not work, even if the builds have the
same version number.
